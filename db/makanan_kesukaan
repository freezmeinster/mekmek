 Most server-side languages have a mechanism for taking predominantly static pages and inserting a dynamically generated component, such as a list of items. Typical examples are scripts in Java Server Pages, PHP scripting and many others. Go has adopted a relatively simple scripting language in the template package.

At the time of writing a new template package has been adopted. There is very little documentation on the template packages. There is a small amount on the old package, which is currently still available in the old/template. There is no documentation on the new package as yet apart from the reference page. The template package changed with r60 (released 2011/09/07).

We describe the new package here. The package is designed to take text as input and output different text, based on transforming the original text using the values of an object. Unlike JSP or similar, it is not restricted to HTML files but it is likely to find greatest use there.

The original source is called a template and will consist of text that is transmitted unchanged, and embedded commands which can act on and change text. The commands are delimited by {{ ... }} , similar to the JSP commands <%= ... =%> and PHPs <?php ... ?>.
